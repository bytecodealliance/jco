# `node:cluster`

| Imports | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| `node:cluster` | `@bytecodealliance/jco-std/wasi/0.2.x/node/24.x.x/cluster` |

A guest has no process model, so `node:cluster` follows the same pattern as
`node:child_process`. When bundled source imports it, Jco ensures the selected world
declares the interface, editing the `.wit` file in place, installing the definition under
`deps/jco-node-0.1.0`, and printing a CLI warning naming the changed files:

```wit
world app {
  import jco:node/cluster@0.1.0;
  // component imports and exports...
}
```

Declaring or generating the import does not grant host access. Jco's default
transpilation map uses a provider that throws `ERR_JCO_CLUSTER_ADAPTER_REQUIRED`, so an
application must make the security decision explicitly, for example by mapping the Node
host provider:

```console
jco transpile component.wasm \
  --map 'jco:node/cluster@0.1.0=@bytecodealliance/jco-std/wasi/0.2.x/node/24.x.x/cluster/host/node'
```

That produces the call path guest `node:cluster` → WIT capability → host adapter → Node
`node:cluster`. Because a transpiled component is itself a Node process, `cluster.fork()`
re-executes the entry, so a forked worker runs the component again and observes itself as
a worker.

Two differences from Node are unavoidable:

- **Event timing.** Node delivers cluster events on its event loop. A guest cannot be
  called back across the host boundary, so events are queued by the host and emitted
  when the guest next touches the module; `cluster.pump()` drains them on demand.
- **Messages cross as JSON.** WIT has no dynamic value type, so values JSON cannot
  represent -- functions, symbols, cycles, `BigInt` -- are rejected rather than
  silently altered.

These throw `ERR_JCO_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_API` rather than failing quietly:

| API                                                                             | Why                                                                                                                                                                |

| `worker.process`                                                                | A `ChildProcess` handle cannot cross the component boundary.                                                                                                       |
| `listening` event, handle sharing                                               | Cluster distributes Node `net` handles; guest servers are `wasi:sockets`, so nothing hooks them. `SCHED_RR` is accepted but does not distribute guest connections. |
| `setupPrimary({ exec, execArgv, stdio, uid, gid, inspectPort, serialization })` | These configure the host runner executing the component, not a guest file.                                                                                         |

`cluster.isMaster` and `cluster.setupMaster()` are deprecated in Node, so they throw
`ERR_JCO_UNSUPPORTED_DEPRECATED_NODE_API` and point at `isPrimary`/`setupPrimary`.
