/**
 * Error codes.
 * 
 * In theory, every API can return any error code.
 * In practice, API's typically only return the errors documented per API
 * combined with a couple of errors that are always possible:
 * - `unknown`
 * - `access-denied`
 * - `not-supported`
 * - `out-of-memory`
 * - `concurrency-conflict`
 * 
 * See each individual API for what the POSIX equivalents are. They sometimes differ per API.
 * # Variants
 * 
 * ## `"unknown"`
 * 
 * Unknown error
 * ## `"access-denied"`
 * 
 * Access denied.
 * 
 * POSIX equivalent: EACCES, EPERM
 * ## `"not-supported"`
 * 
 * The operation is not supported.
 * 
 * POSIX equivalent: EOPNOTSUPP
 * ## `"invalid-argument"`
 * 
 * One of the arguments is invalid.
 * 
 * POSIX equivalent: EINVAL
 * ## `"out-of-memory"`
 * 
 * Not enough memory to complete the operation.
 * 
 * POSIX equivalent: ENOMEM, ENOBUFS, EAI_MEMORY
 * ## `"timeout"`
 * 
 * The operation timed out before it could finish completely.
 * ## `"concurrency-conflict"`
 * 
 * This operation is incompatible with another asynchronous operation that is already in progress.
 * 
 * POSIX equivalent: EALREADY
 * ## `"not-in-progress"`
 * 
 * Trying to finish an asynchronous operation that:
 * - has not been started yet, or:
 * - was already finished by a previous `finish-*` call.
 * 
 * Note: this is scheduled to be removed when `future`s are natively supported.
 * ## `"would-block"`
 * 
 * The operation has been aborted because it could not be completed immediately.
 * 
 * Note: this is scheduled to be removed when `future`s are natively supported.
 * ## `"invalid-state"`
 * 
 * The operation is not valid in the socket's current state.
 * ## `"new-socket-limit"`
 * 
 * A new socket resource could not be created because of a system limit.
 * ## `"address-not-bindable"`
 * 
 * A bind operation failed because the provided address is not an address that the `network` can bind to.
 * ## `"address-in-use"`
 * 
 * A bind operation failed because the provided address is already in use or because there are no ephemeral ports available.
 * ## `"remote-unreachable"`
 * 
 * The remote address is not reachable
 * ## `"connection-refused"`
 * 
 * The connection was forcefully rejected
 * ## `"connection-reset"`
 * 
 * The connection was reset.
 * ## `"connection-aborted"`
 * 
 * A connection was aborted.
 * ## `"datagram-too-large"`
 * 
 * ## `"name-unresolvable"`
 * 
 * Name does not exist or has no suitable associated IP addresses.
 * ## `"temporary-resolver-failure"`
 * 
 * A temporary failure in name resolution occurred.
 * ## `"permanent-resolver-failure"`
 * 
 * A permanent failure in name resolution occurred.
