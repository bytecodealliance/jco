export namespace WasiSocketsUdpCreateSocket {
  /**
   * Create a new UDP socket.
   * 
   * Similar to `socket(AF_INET or AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP)` in POSIX.
   * 
   * This function does not require a network capability handle. This is considered to be safe because
   * at time of creation, the socket is not bound to any `network` yet. Up to the moment `bind`/`connect` is called,
   * the socket is effectively an in-memory configuration object, unable to communicate with the outside world.
   * 
   * All sockets are non-blocking. Use the wasi-poll interface to block on asynchronous operations.
   * 
   * # Typical errors
   * - `not-supported`:     The specified `address-family` is not supported. (EAFNOSUPPORT)
   * - `new-socket-limit`:  The new socket resource could not be created because of a system limit. (EMFILE, ENFILE)
   *
