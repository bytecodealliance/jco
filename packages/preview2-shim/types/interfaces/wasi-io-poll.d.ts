   * 
   * The result `list<u32>` contains one or more indices of handles in the
   * argument list that is ready for I/O.
   * 
   * This function traps if either:
   * - the list is empty, or:
   * - the list contains more elements than can be indexed with a `u32` value.
   * 
   * A timeout can be implemented by adding a pollable from the
   * wasi-clocks API to the list.
   * 
   * This function does not return a `result`; polling in itself does not
   * do any I/O so it doesn't fail. If any of the I/O sources identified by
   * the pollables has an error, it is indicated by marking the source as
   * being ready for I/O.
