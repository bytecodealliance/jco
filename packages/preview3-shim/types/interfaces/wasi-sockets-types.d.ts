 * Error codes.
 *
 * In theory, every API can return any error code.
 * In practice, API's typically only return the errors documented per API
 * combined with a couple of errors that are always possible:
 * - `unknown`
 * - `access-denied`
 * - `not-supported`
 * - `out-of-memory`
 *
 * See each individual API for what the POSIX equivalents are. They sometimes differ per API.
 * # Variants
 *
 * ## `"unknown"`
 *
 * Unknown error
 * ## `"access-denied"`
 *
 * Access denied.
 *
 * POSIX equivalent: EACCES, EPERM
 * ## `"not-supported"`
 *
 * The operation is not supported.
 *
 * POSIX equivalent: EOPNOTSUPP
 * ## `"invalid-argument"`
 *
 * One of the arguments is invalid.
 *
 * POSIX equivalent: EINVAL
 * ## `"out-of-memory"`
 *
 * Not enough memory to complete the operation.
 *
 * POSIX equivalent: ENOMEM, ENOBUFS, EAI_MEMORY
 * ## `"timeout"`
 *
 * The operation timed out before it could finish completely.
 * ## `"invalid-state"`
 *
 * The operation is not valid in the socket's current state.
 * ## `"address-not-bindable"`
 *
 * A bind operation failed because the provided address is not an address that the `network` can bind to.
 * ## `"address-in-use"`
 *
 * A bind operation failed because the provided address is already in use or because there are no ephemeral ports available.
 * ## `"remote-unreachable"`
 *
 * The remote address is not reachable
 * ## `"connection-refused"`
 *
 * The TCP connection was forcefully rejected
 * ## `"connection-reset"`
 *
 * The TCP connection was reset.
 * ## `"connection-aborted"`
 *
 * A TCP connection was aborted.
 * ## `"datagram-too-large"`
 *
 * The size of a datagram sent to a UDP socket exceeded the maximum
 * supported size.

     * Normally, the returned sockets are bound, in the `connected` state

     * by the time the server attempts to perform its first I/O on it. This
     * is true regardless of whether the WASI implementation uses
     * "synthesized" sockets or not (see Implementors Notes below).
     *
     * The following properties are inherited from the listener socket:
     * - `address-family`

     * - `keep-alive-idle-time`

     *
     * # Implementors note
     * This method returns a single perpetual stream that should only close
     * on fatal errors (if any). Yet, the POSIX' `accept` function may also
     * return transient errors (e.g. ECONNABORTED). The exact details differ
     * per operation system. For example, the Linux manual mentions:
     *
     * > Linux accept() passes already-pending network errors on the new
     * > socket as an error code from accept(). This behavior differs from
     * > other BSD socket implementations. For reliable operation the
     * > application should detect the network errors defined for the
     * > protocol after accept() and treat them like EAGAIN by retrying.
     * > In the case of TCP/IP, these are ENETDOWN, EPROTO, ENOPROTOOPT,
     * > EHOSTDOWN, ENONET, EHOSTUNREACH, EOPNOTSUPP, and ENETUNREACH.
     * Source: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/accept.2.html
     *
     * WASI implementations have two options to handle this:
     * - Optionally log it and then skip over non-fatal errors returned by
     *   `accept`. Guest code never gets to see these failures. Or:
     * - Synthesize a `tcp-socket` resource that exposes the error when
     *   attempting to send or receive on it. Guest code then sees these
     *   failures as regular I/O errors.
     *
     * In either case, the stream returned by this `listen` method remains
     * operational.
