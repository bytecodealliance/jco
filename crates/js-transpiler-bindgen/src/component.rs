//! Support to generate bindings for a host for a single component.
//!
//! This is currently used by the JS host generator and is planned to be used
//! for the Python host generator as well. This module is conditionally defined
//! since it depends on a few somewhat-heavyweight dependencies.
//!
//! The main definition here is the `ComponentGenerator` trait as well as the
//! `generate` function.
