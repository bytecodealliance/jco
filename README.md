## Overview

Jco provides a fully native JS toolchain for working with [WebAssembly Components](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model) in JavaScript.

Features include:

* "Transpiling" Wasm Component binaries into ES modules that can run in any JS environment.
* WASI Preview2 support in Node.js ([undergoing stabilization](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/milestone/1)) & browsers (experimental).
* Component builds of [Wasm Tools](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools) helpers, available for use as a library or CLI commands for use in native JS environments, as well as optimization helper for Components via Binaryen.
* Run and serve commands like Wasmtime, as JS implementations of the Command and HTTP Proxy worlds.
* "Componentize" command to easily create components written in JavaScript (wrapper of [ComponentizeJS](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/ComponentizeJS)).

For creating components in other languages, see the [Cargo Component](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-Component) project for Rust and [Wit Bindgen](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen) for various guest bindgen helpers.

> **Note**: This is an experimental project, no guarantees are provided for stability, security or support and breaking changes may be made without notice.

## Installation

```shell
npm install @bytecodealliance/jco
```

Jco can be used as either a library import or as a CLI via the `jco` command.

## Example

See the [example workflow](docs/src/example.md) page for a full usage example.

## CLI

```shell
Usage: jco <command> [options]

  help [command]                        display help for command
```

For help with individual command options, use `jco <cmd> --help`.

### Transpile

To transpile a component into JS:

```
jco transpile component.wasm -o out-dir
```

The resultant file can be imported providing the bindings of the component as if it were imported directly:

app.js
```
import { fn } from './out-dir/component.js';

fn();
```

Imports can be remapped using the `--map` flag, or to provide imports as an argument use the `--instantiation` option.

Components relying on WASI bindings will contain external WASI imports, which are automatically updated
to the `@bytecodealliance/preview-shim` package. This package can be installed from npm separately for
runtime usage. This shim layer supports both Node.js and browsers.

Options include:
* `--name`: Give a custom name for the component JS file in `out-dir/[name].js`
* `--minify`: Minify the component JS
* `--optimize`: Runs the internal core Wasm files through Binaryen for optimization. Optimization options can be passed with a `-- <binaryen options>` flag separator.
* `--tla-compat`: Instead of relying on top-level-await, requires an `$init` promise to be imported and awaited first.
* `--js`: Converts core Wasm files to JavaScript for environments that don't even support core Wasm.
* `--base64-cutoff=<number>`: Sets the maximum number of bytes for inlining Wasm files into the JS using base64 encoding. Set to zero to disable base64 inlining entirely.
* `--no-wasi-shim`: Disable the WASI shim mapping to `@bytecodealliance/preview2-shim`.
* `--map`: Provide custom mappings for world imports. Supports both wildcard mappings (`*` similarly as in the package.json "exports" field) as well as `#` mappings for targetting exported interfaces. For example, the WASI mappings are internally defined with mappings like `--map wasi:filesystem/*=@bytecodealliance/preview2-shim/filesystem#*` to map `import as * filesystem from 'wasi:filesystem/types'` to `import { types } from '@bytecodealliance/preview2-shim/filesystem`.
* `--no-nodejs-compat`: Disables Node.js compat in the output to load core Wasm with FS methods.
* `--instantiation [mode]`: Instead of a direct ES module, export an `instantiate` function which can take the imports as an argument instead of implicit imports. The `instantiate` function can be async (with `--instantiation` or `--instantiation async`), or sync (with `--instantiation sync`).
* `--valid-lifting-optimization`: Internal validations are removed assuming that core Wasm binaries are valid components, providing a minor output size saving.
* `--tracing`: Emit tracing calls for all function entry and exits.
* `--no-namespaced-exports`: Removes exports of the type `test as "test:flavorful/test"` which are not compatible with typescript

#### Bindgen Crate

To directly call into the transpilation in Rust, the bindgen used in jco is also available on crates.io as [js-component-bindgen](https://crates.io/crates/js-component-bindgen).

### Run & Serve

For Wasm components that implement the WASI Command world, a `jco run` utility is provided to run these applications in Node.js.

```
jco run cowasy.component.wasm hello
```

Using the preview2-shim WASI implementation, full access to the underlying system primitives is provided, including filesystem and environment variable permissions.

For HTTP Proxy components, `jco serve` provides a JS server implementation:

```
jco serve --port 8080 server.wasm
```

> [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) generally provides the most performant implementation for executing command and proxy worlds to use. These implementations are rather for when JS virtualization is required or the most convenient approach.

### Componentize

To componentize a JS file run:

```
jco componentize app.js --wit wit -n world-name -o component.wasm
```

Creates a component from a JS module implementing a WIT world definition, via a Spidermonkey engine embedding.

Currently requires an explicit install of the componentize-js engine via `npm install @bytecodealliance/componentize-js`.

See [ComponentizeJS](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-js) for more details on this process.

> Additional engines might be supported in future via an `--engine` field or otherwise.
